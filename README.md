# Structural Variation Viewer

A suite of Python-based tools to visualize genomic variation, with focus on structural variants. 
The suite consists of a number of command-line scripts as well as a graphical user interface for visual data exploration. 
__SVread.py__ and __SVsee.py__ extract variant data from VCF files and visualize them respectively. __SVsee.py__ can be display additional annotation data corresponding to the used VCF file and a heat map with selectable window size.
Both functionalities are boundled in __SVpipe.py__ to allow for a one-step process between data and figure.
__SVpipe.py__'s functionality is extended with a GUI in SVgui.py. 

## Prerequisites
The SVx.py programs require __Python 3.7.6__, __matplotlib version 3.2.1__, __tkinter version 8.6__ and __Numpy version 1.18.3__.

The [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installers provide quick and easy installation instructions and bring the other prerequisites.
Alternatively, you can install Python 3 with your preferred method and then additionally download the other prerequisites.
